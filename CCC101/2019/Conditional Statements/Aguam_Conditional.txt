Conditional Statement

1. Imagine you're writing a simple program to check the age of a user and determine 
if they are eligible to vote. If the user's age is 18 or above, the program should display 
"You are eligible to vote." Otherwise, it should display "Sorry, you must be at least 18 years old to vote." 
How would you structure the if-else statement to achieve this in your chosen programming language?

2. In a coding scenario, you're building a weather application. 
You want to display different messages based on the temperature conditions. 
If the temperature is above 75°F, you want to show "It's a warm day!", and if it's below 50°F, 
you want to display "Don't forget your jacket!" 
How would you structure a conditional statement to achieve this in your chosen programming language?
